# Quansheng_UV-K5_PCB_R51-V1.4
This GitHub repository contains high resolution pictures of the Quansheng UV-K5 V1.4 PCB. 
The PCB has been sanded down manually to expose both inner layers. The first (front) layer is where the display of the Quansheng UV-K5 radio is located. The back layer is closest to the radio's battery.

As one half of the layer pictures has to be mirrored to be able to click through all layers and not loose track, I have created two alignment sets:
- https://github.com/mentalDetector/Quansheng_UV-K5_PCB_R51-V1.4/tree/main/Quansheng_UV-K5_PCB_R51-V1.4_JPG_aligned_front_to_back contains a stack where the back layers are mirrored.
- https://github.com/mentalDetector/Quansheng_UV-K5_PCB_R51-V1.4/tree/main/Quansheng_UV-K5_PCB_R51-V1.4_JPG_aligned_back_to_front contains a stack where the front layers are mirrored.

 Thanks to https://github.com/manujedi for donating the PCB!
