# Quansheng_UV-K5_PCB_R51-V1.4
 This GitHub repository contains high resolution pictures of the Quansheng UV-K5 V1.4 PCB. 
The PCB has been sanded down manually to expose both inner layers. The first (front) layer is where the display of the Quansheng UV-K5 radio is located. The back layer is closest to the radio's battery.
