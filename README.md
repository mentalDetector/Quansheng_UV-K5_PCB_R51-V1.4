# Quansheng_UV-K5_PCB_R51-V1.4
 This GitHub repository contains high resolution pictures of the Quansheng UV-K5 V1.4 PCB. Layers have been sanded down to expose both inner layers. The first (front) layer is where the display of the Quansheng UV-K5 radio is located. The back layer is closest to the radio's battery.

 Thanks to https://github.com/manujedi for donating the PCB!
